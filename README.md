# 🛡️ Wallet Risk Scoring from Scratch

This project evaluates the on-chain risk of Ethereum wallets based on their activity with the Compound V2 protocol. It analyzes wallet behavior using DeFi data and assigns a risk score from **0 (low risk)** to **1000 (high risk)**. The goal is to help identify potentially risky wallet behaviors for DeFi platforms, auditors, or analysts.

---

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- Connects to **Moralis API** to retrieve real-time wallet data from the Ethereum mainnet.
- Extracts key features that impact DeFi risk (e.g. borrow/supply ratio, liquidation history, token diversity).
- Applies **KMeans clustering** and **Random Forest modeling** to generate a refined risk score.
- Outputs risk scores in CSV format and includes insightful visualizations.

## 📊 Features Extracted

| Feature               | Description                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Leverage Risk         | Borrowed vs Supplied assets                 |
| Liquidation Risk      | Count of past liquidations                  |
| Portfolio Size Risk   | Total exposure in USD                       |
| Diversification Risk  | Number of unique tokens held                |
| Health Risk           | Estimated safety ratio (supply/borrow)      |

## 🧠 How Scoring Works

1. **Rule-Based Weighting**: Each feature is weighted (e.g., leverage = 30%, liquidation = 25%, etc.)
2. **Clustering**: KMeans clustering groups wallets into 5 behavior-based segments.
3. **ML Refinement**: A Random Forest model refines and predicts a normalized risk score.
4. **Scaling**: Final scores are scaled to a 0–1000 range.
